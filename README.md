# Users Directory

## How to use it

- Install dependencies running `npm install`.
- Run it! `npm start`.

It will run a server listening at port `3000` exposing these endpoints:

- `GET /people`: It returns an array of people in the directory.
- `GET /people/by-name/:name`: It returns people that have the given string in the first or last name.
